## Factorio Achievement Restore Readme

Factorio Achievement Restore is a tool created by 0x796935 based on the research/method of u/KimJonhUnsSon on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/rlprxh/text_tutorial_for_reenabling_achievements_after/). This tool helps you restore achievements in Factorio after using console commands or mods.

based on comments on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/1gacff0/enabling_achievements_after_using_console_commands/) I modified this to find new cheat flags and restore. I have tested this locally and it seems fine. I have also tried it multiple times and it seems to work.
